Requirements
------------

PyPlanet runs on Python 3.5 and later. Most linux distributions contain default packages or will come with Python
preinstalled. To be 100% sure you have to check if you have Python 3 and your version is above 3.5.

**Summary of requirements:**

* Python 3.5+ and pip 9+
* Virtualenv (see: http://pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/ )
* SQLite3 (no requirements needed), MySQL Server or PostgreSQL Server.
* Maniaplanet Dedicated, local or remote (may require more configuration).
