General Information
===================

PyPlanet is a controller that tries to focus on stability, scalability, speed and tries to be able to maintain for
a long time due to it's architecture and abstracting from direct access of callbacks.

By abstracting most of the scripted callbacks, you are able to have the same plugins running after several large game and
script updates.

In the documentation you can find information about the requirements, installation and operation. And specially for the
apps developers we have the technical sections containing lots of information to build your app.
